    <h2>SoC Subsystem Verification using SystemVerilog/UVM</h2>
    <p>
      Developed a UVM-based verification environment for a SoC-level subsystem including bus interfaces,
      control registers, and memory-mapped peripherals. Implemented constrained-random stimulus,
      functional coverage, and assertion-based checks to drive coverage closure. Debugged RTL issues
      using waveform analysis and automated regressions with Python/Tcl.
    </p>

    <h2>FPGA-Based ALU Design, Integration, and Verification</h2>
    <p>
      Designed a 32-bit ALU in Verilog supporting arithmetic and logical operations.
      Built SystemVerilog testbenches with directed and randomized tests and synthesized the design
      for FPGA implementation. Validated functionality and analyzed timing and resource utilization
      using Vivado.
    </p>

    <h2>Formal Property Verification of Control Logic</h2>
    <p>
      Authored SystemVerilog Assertions (SVA) to verify FSM behavior, protocol correctness,
      and clock-gating conditions. Applied formal verification techniques to explore corner cases
      and unreachable states, improving robustness and power awareness.
    </p>

    <h2>Low-Power Memory Controller Design</h2>
    <p>
      Architected and implemented an SRAM controller with clock-gating and low-power operating modes.
      Balanced latency, power, and timing constraints through RTL refinement and STA-driven analysis,
      achieving approximately 20% power efficiency improvement without functional impact.
    </p>

    <h2>Digital System Integration & Timing Validation</h2>
    <p>
      Integrated multiple RTL blocks into a system-level design with clean, timing-safe interfaces.
      Performed synthesis, static timing analysis, and gate-level simulation to resolve critical path
      issues and validated post-synthesis correctness through equivalence checking.
    </p>

    <h2>Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) Design & Simulation</h2>
    <p>
      Designed and simulated a complete PLL including VCO, phase-frequency detector,
      charge pump, and passive loop filter using LTspice and MATLAB. Analyzed loop stability,
      lock time, and frequency behavior, and evaluated clocking tradeoffs relevant to SoC systems.
